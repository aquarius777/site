						<h1>What is ΣRGO?</h1>
						<p>ΣRGO is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers multiple improvements for different blockchain layers. The idea behind ΣRGO is to make cryptocurrencies decentralized again by providing user-friendly way for trustless blockchain exploring and verification. Ergo is more like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it is updated version of the two for sure.</p>
					</li>
					    <li>
						<h1>Will there be an ICO?</h1>
						<p>It is not decided yet if there will be an ICO or whether the ΣRGO tokens will be mined into existence like ZCash.</p>
					</li>
					    <li>
						<h1>Is there any more airdrops to WCT holders?</h1>
						<p>All the airdrops surely will be in secret before being happening, and we are not limiting them to WCT holders.</p>
					</li>
					    <li>
						<h1>When will the ΣRGO network launch?</h1>
						<p>No exact dates atm, we&#39;ll provide estimations on Yellow Paper release (following Eth here), but we expect Testnet to be up and running in October 2017 and Mainnet in May 2018.</p>
					</li>
					    <li>
						<h1>Do you need translators?</h1>
						<p>Translations would be good, after whitepaper release</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h1>Can I mine ΣRGO?</h1>
						<p>Not yet. One of the PoW candidate is like ZCash, it could be used with different parameters though. But the mining algo isn&#39;t fixed yet.</p>
					</li>

						<h1>Why would businesses want to use Ergo over Stratis if they could achieve the same results(i.e. guaranteed verification of program execution properties like length, mem usage etc.) using C# as smart contract programming language solution(in Visual Studio)?</h1>
                        <p>
                            For a general-purpose language, there&#39;s no guarantee of termination of a non-trivial program (it could be the case only for some special languages e.g. Coq or Agda)</p>
                        <p>
                            The answer may be quite complicated, but let&#39;s emphasize 2 points:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. It&#39;s hard (even impossible in theory) to estimate evaluation costs for programs on general-purpose languages like C# before evaluation itself. This leads to continuous DDoS attacks, like attacks to Ethereum last autumn. Sigma language cost analysis will be much easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. In Ethereum there is &quot;gas limit&quot;, so you can&#39;t create really complicated contracts. And again, it&#39;s quite hard to estimate, whether some contract is possible in Ethereum (within gas limit) or not. Also this &quot;gas limit&quot; is not constant, so your contract may work now, but in future miners may reduce gas limit and you&#39;ll be out of business. So in theory everything is possible in Turing-complete languages, but in practice this leads to a lot of problems.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h1>Will there be hard-forks in ΣRGO?</h1>
						<p>Ergo will be focused on soft-forkability, also for the updates of its programming language Sigma.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h1>Will ΣRGO and Waves be cooperating or Ergo is a separate project?</h1>
						<p>There will be cooperation it some researches, but Ergo will be separate and independent project.</p>
					</li>
